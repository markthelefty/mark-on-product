Apologies in advance for the length of this, but if we’re going to do it, we need the full story. In short I never planned to get into Product Management or Software design, but most people don’t end up where they started right? Here’s how it happened for me.

## The Music Business (1995)

Like every kid in the world, when I was young I was a huge music fan. I think this comes mostly from my mother who is a fairly talented singer/musician herself. I spent hours listening to music, in particular, tearing open a new cassette, CD, or LP, and as I listened I loved reading the credits and liner notes. As I did this over the years I became fascinated with how records were made and the people that made them. I was (and still am) a huge fan of hip-hop, I’m by no means a thug or a “gangsta” but for whatever reason it always resonated with me. Few people on the planet can beat me at 90’s hip-hop trivia, you’ll see why in a minute. I was never really a talented musician, but I certainly had an ear for sound and was pretty good at putting songs (and later) albums together.

By the time I was in high-school, I knew the names of most engineers, producers, mastering engineers and recording studios in the country. In particular I followed the New York hip-hop scene most closely. I was a huge big fan of A Tribe Called Quest. The Low End Theory is still my favorite album of all time. The Engineer that recorded and mixed most of their albums was an Engineer named Bob Power. At that time Bob liked to work at a recording studio in Manhattan called Battery Studios. It was in 1991 that I cracked open my Low End Theory cassette and decided I needed to be in the music business. I needed to be a recording engineer. I needed to work at Battery Studios. I needed to work with Bob Power.

I graduated high school and moved directly to New York city to pursue my dream. After a year of audio school and an internship or two, I was cleaning toilets at Battery Studios - I MADE IT LOL! It wasn’t long before Bob was coming in for a session, it happened to be with the ROOTS. I loved the ROOTS and was excited both they and Bob were coming in for a few weeks to mix an album that became “Things Fall Apart”. I met Bob in the hallway on one of the first few days they were in and I’ll never forget it. It was the first time I’d ever met someone I truly idolized. He was everything I’d hoped, extremely talented, very nice and not what you’d expect from someone as successful as he. As luck would have it the Assistant Engineer that Bob normally worked with got sick a few days into the session and Bob asked if I’d like to assist him in the mix sessions. Um yes…! I couldn’t believe it.

I got to know Bob pretty well, we ended up working on a number of projects together. I was an assistant engineer for a few years at Battery before eventually going freelance. As a freelance engineer I worked at studios all over the city on many large and small projects. I got to know many many musicians, engineers, and producers, my voice even appeared on an album or two. A few of the names I worked with: Fat Joe, The Wu-Tang Clan, The ROOTS, Eminem, Q-Tip, Big Pun, Method Man, NSYNC, Henry Rollins, Jay-Z, LL Cool J, Kid Rock, Pharrell, The Backstreet Boys, Just Blaze, Blues Traveller, Dave Matthews, Jeff Buckley, Alicia Keys, Pete Rock, DMX, Brittany Spears. I have lots of stories, let’s get a beer sometime, I’ll tell you a few.

So what happened? Well in short the music business ended up getting completely disrupted. They had no plans or strategy for life after selling physical media. They never saw digital coming - at all. Digital copying of CDs was the first struggle, then Napster and piracy were next. Album sales plummeted, artists struggled to sell CDs and eventually most of the studios ended up closing.

Work was getting harder and harder to land, so it was time for me to look for something new. I landed a pretty neat gig doing sound at Saturday Nigh Live. It was really cool for a little while but after two seasons I decided it wasn’t for me. If I couldn’t make records, my time in the music biz was probably over. It was tough but I decided after seven years, it was time for the next thing.

## The Liquor Store (2002)

So - I bought a liquor store, I know it seems weird. But after a few years watching the music business die, I wanted something I controlled, something I owned. So with a bank loan and some help form my parents I bought a small liquor store in North Jersey. It was so exciting, most people thought I was nuts, the others were excited by my enthusiasm and energy about it. My single goal was to grow the business in every way I could. I did all kinds of “growth hacks” from a full re-brand to offering a new delivery service.

But the thing that I was most proud of - was building a website for the store. This was still the early days of the web and selling wine online in New Jersey had recently become completely legal. The idea of a wine website wasn’t completely new. There was a store in the town where we lived at the time called the Wine Library, I noticed the insane business they were doing there. This store was run by a father and son, the son turned out to be Gary Vaynerchuk. It was rumored that they were doing $50 million a year on the web alone. I’m still not sure if that number is accurate but I suspect it’s probably close. I thought if I did 10% of that I was set.

I didn’t have the skills to build the site myself so I hired a customer of my store who built websites on the side to build it for me. I paid him a pretty good amount of money and ended up with the typical “50% of a website”. He couldn’t really deliver the entire site in the end and I couldn’t afford to hire someone else to finish it. I had no choice but to roll up my sleeves, dig in and learn to code. I also learned a fair amount about digital marketing too. I got that site finished and it went LIVE!

The store was great, but after working 6-7 days a week for a few years I decided retail wasn’t really for me. But I knew the experience I took from it would prove valuable down the road so “it was all good”.

## Wine/Liquor Salesman (2005)

After selling the store and having our first child, I was ready for some normal hours and weekends. I never really viewed myself as a sales guy. But I was good at forming relationships, following through and was always self driven. So I interviewed for a position at one of the distributions that sold Wine and Liquor to my store. Fedway Associates was one of the largest Wine and Liquor distributors in New Jersey at the time. I interviewed with one of the Division Sales Managers on a Friday morning and he offered me a job on the spot. I was excited. I never really planned it but at the time it felt right and was sort of the right thing at the time.

The best part was as I drove all over the state from store to store all day I could listen to podcasts and listen to videos playing on my laptop from the passenger seat. This proved to be huge, because I couldn’t get my mind off the web, off coding and web design or SEO, or anything web really. I loved it. I eat, drank and slept it. It felt like my teenage years with the music all over again. I was studying every podcast and blog I could get my hands on. I was unintentionally becoming an expert.

I started to think “these skills feel like they could be valuable”.

## Web Designer (2009)

So that was it, I decided I wanted to build websites. I tried my hand at a few things around the web and ultimately decided I wanted to build websites for businesses and help them get customers. I was still selling Wine and Liquor as my day job, but I spent nights and weekends building the websites. I literally went door-to-door in my town to get the first few clients. Before I knew it I had a small business on my hands. I wasn’t getting rich, but I was getting pretty good at building and selling them.

Eventually a mutual friend connected me to a guy who had a similar sized business looking to grow. I was looking for a path to build websites full-time, partnering made sense for both of us. So I took the plunge, partnered with Lou Kotsinins and co-founded BCS Interactive. BCS was great, we build websites and apps for mostly small businesses and non-profits. Lou is still going strong with it today. But after a few years I was getting a little burnt on it and needed all of the trimmings that come along with a real corporate job. So we amicably parted ways and I started job hunting.

## Product Manager (2012)

Luckily the job market was pretty strong. I decided that my favorite part of my time at BCS was really design, specifically app UI design. So that’s what I decided to focus on in the search. I interviewed at lots of companies large and small, mostly in NYC. It was an interesting experience, I discovered some of that startups and agencies I admired weren’t really all that cool.

Eventually I saw a job posting for a UI design gig at E\*TRADE Financial and went on the interview. I ended up being offered a job as a Senior Designer on the design team. I had no Financial Services Industry experience at all, but I had a pretty good portfolio and hit it off with the Creative Director.  That was it. I was hired, before I knew it I was next deep in some pretty cool projects.

I got to work on fun marketing projects, the Super Bowl ads and lots of UI design. Exposed to all of the various parts of a real company, the UI and app design was still the thing I really loved doing. I especially enjoyed really building something big from beginning to end. It reminded me of making records. UI design eventually turned into running a UX prototyping team. Protoyping eventually turned into owning a product. And there it was… holy moly I’m in Product Management. I started as some dude off the street who started in the Music biz and in five years I was Vice President of Product Management. I was as surprised as anyone. But truth be told I had been working nights and weekends for years. If felt like an overnight success but it really wasn’t at all.

## Today (2018)

Today I live in Atlanta, Georgia. I’m married to my high school sweetheart and we have three awesome kids.

I’m VP, Product Management at E\*TRADE Corporate Services. Our platform (Equity Edge Online) is used by many of the largest companies in the world to manage their equity compensation benefit programs. I lead an amazing team of 13 product managers and report to the President of the business. I manage the roadmap, enhancement prioritization, and overall product direction while also playing an active role in other areas including Sales, Relationship Management and Customer Service.
