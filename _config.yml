  bio: Hi! I’m Mark Mitchell. I’m VP of Product at a large financial services company.
    I lead an awesome team of 13 Product Managers. Most of my days are spent helping
    them solve the challenges they come across while delivering some truly great products.
    Like many Product Managers, I traveled an unusual path to get here. <a href="/about-mark-mitchell">Here’s
    the full scoop</a>.
