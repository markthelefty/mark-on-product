<p>Mark is an unassuming <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It&#8217;s based on <a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole</a>, the Jekyll butler.</p>

<h3 id="builtonpoole">Built on Poole</h3>

<p>Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, <a href="/404">404</a>, <a href="/atom.xml">RSS feed</a>, posts, and <a href="/about">example page</a>)</li>
<li>Mobile friendly design and development</li>
<li>Easily scalable text and component sizing with <code>rem</code> units in the CSS</li>
<li>Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements</li>
<li>Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lanyonfeatures">Lanyon features</h3>

<p>In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via <strong>â˜°</strong> link in top corner</li>
<li>Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support</li>
<li>Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout">reverse</a> (right sidebar), available via <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> classes</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes">Eight optional color schemes</a>, available via <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> classes</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme">Head to the readme</a> to learn more.</p>

<h3 id="browsersupport">Browser support</h3>

<p>Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.</p>

<h3 id="download">Download</h3>

<p>Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
