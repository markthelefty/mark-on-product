    Hi! My career started in 1996 as a recording engineer in the music business in New York City. Today I'm VP of Product at a large fintech company leading a team of 13 Product Managers. I live in Atlanta with my wonderful wife and our three children. Like many Product Managers, I traveled an unusual path to get here. [Here’s the full scoop](/about-mark-mitchell).

    I’d like to hear from you. Feel free to [send me a note](https://markonproduct.com/contact), or let's connect on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarkMitchell) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markreidmitchell/).
